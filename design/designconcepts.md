Design Concepts


Design concept idea.
Im going to be using photos of my cats because everyone loves cats. 
And I have three. So should be a home run.  :) Like the Zen Garden, cats warm the heart.

How I expect to affect users with the style
I think like in my print design work. I want to protray a sense of harmony where you want to read 
the content because of the visual usage of art and typography. 

Styles I liked:
This one I liked the static background and the scrolling information area. http://www.csszengarden.com/216/
I love this one. Because of the pop up robot and the colors and illustrations http://www.csszengarden.com/215/
I love the simplicity of this design. http://www.csszengarden.com/217/ but it didn't really give me an area to rest. 
Probably my favorite one. And the one I am using to design the basics of my site on. http://www.csszengarden.com/218/ long scrolling.
